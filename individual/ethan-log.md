Time was spent creating the requirements and planning the project at a high level. My effort involved re-writing all of our initial requirements after meeting with the other teams and spending more time thinking about what our project should do.

Early in the week time was spent refactoring our system architecture diagram after meeting with other teams and getting feedback. Later in the week time was spent working on the project proposal, where I outlined our scope and target users, proposed solution and interesting / unique features, as well writing out our functional requirements with minor refactoring from previous.
