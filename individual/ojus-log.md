### What Went Well
  - Created the initial system architecture diagram with Sparsh (based on Ronit's draft with Ribhav) and got it ready for the Wednesday in-class activity.
  - Spoke to 4 teams on Wednesday about our proposed system architecture diagram, with a split between cloud and local processing
  - Proposed that the team meet twice a week to stay on the same page. Set up a when2meet instance to decide on meeting times.
  - Had a team meeting to finalise project requirements :)

  ### What Didn't Go Well
  - Sparsh and I had to stay pretty late on Tuesday to get the system architecture ready for the in-class activity. To prevent this from happening, we pitched the idea of having a short team meeting on Mon/Tue to get the team on the same page. The team was happy and understanding

  ### Planning for Next Week
  - Working on DFDs for the upcoming week
  - Doing research and having group Knowledge Transfers
  - Meeting twice during the week
