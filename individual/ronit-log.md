### What Went Well

- **DFD Collaboration**: Worked with the team on Monday to create a draft of the Level 0 and Level 1 DFDs
- **DFD Notation Review**: After reviewing DFD notation, identified that we were missing the file system as an entity and added it to improve the diagram
- **Level 1 Enhancement**: Expanded the Level 1 diagram with additional details to make it more comprehensive
- **Feedback Compilation**: Compiled a list of changes that need to be made based on feedback received
- **Smooth Workflow**: Everything went smoothly this week with no major issues or complications

### What Didn't Go Well

- Nothing major - overall smooth and productive week

### Planning for Next Week

- Review the system design to ensure it aligns with our current understanding
- Populate the Kanban/task board based on the Milestone 1 requirements
- Research more about Python integration with Tauri for our backend implementation

### What Went Well

- **System Architecture Design**: Created the initial draft of our system architecture diagram based on in-class discussions and previous week's requirements
- **Tech Stack Research**: Researched and decided on major parts of our tech stack for our proposal
- **Team Collaboration**: Everyone had good contributions and ideas which made discussions easier

### What Didn't Go Well

- **Decision Making Challenges**: I was personally divided in making some decisions (tech stack)
- **Architecture Modifications**: I was also a bit hesitant with modifying system architecture to go completely local
- **Resolution**: Eventually came to conclusions that everyone was happy with and met everyone's preferences

### Planning for Next Week

- Create DFDs
- Conduct more research on tech stack compatibility
  - Investigate if our chosen tech stack will work smoothly with Tauri + Python plugin for the backend
