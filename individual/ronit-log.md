- **Architecture Modifications**: I was also a bit hesitant with modifying system architecture to go completely local

### Planning for Next Week

- Create DFDs
- Conduct more research on tech stack compatibility
  - Investigate if our chosen tech stack will work smoothly with Tauri + Python plugin for the backend
