This week was fairly light in work, as we were meeting as a team for the first time, and brainstorming Project Requirements. This initial brainstorming was a collaborative effort. My specific contributions were to take the brainstorming notes, and write the foundational functional requirements, in a properly formatted list (i.e "The system shall ... ) in preparation for the class discussions on Wednesday. This was completed in a timely manner.

This week we spent a fair amount of time planning the System Architecture. I contributed an initial sketch to work off of, and my team members drew up a more detailed diagram. After our discussions with other teams on Wednesday, I suggested that we narrow our focus and draw up a more simplified System Architecture Design. Ethan and I got the new diagram started, and I finalized it. Later in the week, we held a team meeting and worked on formulating our Project Proposal. My main contribution here was brainstorming the workload distribution.

This week we had a few members pull a late night on Tuesday, in preparation for Wednesday's class, which left us scrambling a bit before the group discussions on Wednesday. This week we plan to have a team meeting on Monday, or Tuesday, in order to be better prepared for the class discussions on Wednesday.

We got the System Architecture Diagram finished earlier in the week, which allowed us to focus on the Project Proposal this weekend. Next week I think we should replicate this by ensuring the Data Flow Diagram is completed in a similarly timely fashion, to avoid last minute scrambling over the weekend.

### Team Activities
- Discussed and drew up Data Flow Diagram
- Participated in class discussion about the Data Flow Diagram, and received feedback from professor
- Finalized Data Flow Diagram

### What went well
- Data Flow Diagram helped team gain clarity on project, in greater detail
- Discussions with other teams revealed similar Data Flow Diagram solutions, increasing the team's confidence in our own solutions
- Despite not being able to attend team meeting, I was able to contribute to the Data Flow Diagram later in the week. This was thanks to our decision to have a team meeting earlier in the week, allowing for more flexibility

### What didn't go well
- I personally was not able to attend the team meeting on Tuesday, as personal schedule conflicted

### Next Week's Plans
- Begin assigning tasks to members and start coding
- Ensure GitHub branches are organized and a system is in place to ensure smooth project workflow in the future
