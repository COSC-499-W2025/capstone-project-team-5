This week was fairly light in work, as we were meeting as a team for the first time, and brainstorming Project Requirements. This initial brainstorming was a collaborative effort. My specific contributions were to take the brainstorming notes, and write the foundational functional requirements, in a properly formatted list (i.e "The system shall ... ) in preparation for the class discussions on Wednesday. This was completed in a timely manner.

This week we spent a fair amount of time planning the System Architecture. I contributed an initial sketch to work off of, and my team members drew up a more detailed diagram. After our discussions with other teams on Wednesday, I suggested that we narrow our focus and draw up a more simplified System Architecture Design. Ethan and I got the new diagram started, and I finalized it. Later in the week, we held a team meeting and worked on formulating our Project Proposal. My main contribution here was brainstorming the workload distribution.

This week we had a few members pull a late night on Tuesday, in preparation for Wednesday's class, which left us scrambling a bit before the group discussions on Wednesday. This week we plan to have a team meeting on Monday, or Tuesday, in order to be better prepared for the class discussions on Wednesday.

We got the System Architecture Diagram finished earlier in the week, which allowed us to focus on the Project Proposal this weekend. Next week I think we should replicate this by ensuring the Data Flow Diagram is completed in a similarly timely fashion, to avoid last minute scrambling over the weekend.

### Team Activities
- Discussed and drew up Data Flow Diagram
- Participated in class discussion about the Data Flow Diagram, and received feedback from professor
- Finalized Data Flow Diagram

### What went well
- Data Flow Diagram helped team gain clarity on project, in greater detail
- Discussions with other teams revealed similar Data Flow Diagram solutions, increasing the team's confidence in our own solutions
- Despite not being able to attend team meeting, I was able to contribute to the Data Flow Diagram later in the week. This was thanks to our decision to have a team meeting earlier in the week, allowing for more flexibility

### What didn't go well
- I personally was not able to attend the team meeting on Tuesday, as personal schedule conflicted

### Next Week's Plans
- Begin assigning tasks to members and start coding
- Ensure GitHub branches are organized and a system is in place to ensure smooth project workflow in the future

Last week was mostly spent on team meetings and assigning people to tasks. To do this, I drew up a revised Work Breakdown Structure after reviewing the finalized Milestone 1 requirements. Afterwards we held a team meeting to further hammer out the Work Breakdown Structure to come up with a distributed workload that the team was confident in. After this was achieved we moved onto initializing the project, and starting code contributions and reviews. Next sprint we plan to increase our frequency and volume of code contributions in order to establish a sustainable pace to complete all requirements for Milestone 1 within the deadline.

### Previous Week:

This past week included Quiz #1 and, for many members of the team, midterms in other classes. As a result we chose not to overload everyone, and instead focused on furthering code contributions in our given areas of responsibility. This adjustment works contrary to our plan of increasing our frequency and volume of code contributions, slightly, but it was a good adjustment for everyone's overall workload. I've started the code for Requirement 13: "Output all key information for a project." Next sprint appears to be lighter on my personal overall workload, and as such I plan to contribute more code and code reviews, sooner in the week. We have also identified a small issue with regards to GitHub branches where we have been merging our features into main, rather than the develop branch. We plan to amend this in the upcoming week.

### Previous Week:
| Task  | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :------ | :------- |
| Start R13 Code | Completed | "Output all key information for a project." |

### Next Week:
| Task | Status | Notes |
| :---- | :----- | :------- |
| Reorganize GitHub Branches | Not Yet Started | Merge main into develop. |
| Start R15 Code | Not Yet Started | "Retrieve previously generated portfolio information." |
