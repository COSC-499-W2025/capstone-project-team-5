This week was fairly light in work, as we were meeting as a team for the first time, and brainstorming Project Requirements. This initial brainstorming was a collaborative effort. My specific contributions were to take the brainstorming notes, and write the foundational functional requirements, in a properly formatted list (i.e "The system shall ... ) in preparation for the class discussions on Wednesday. This was completed in a timely manner.

This week we spent a fair amount of time planning the System Architecture. I contributed an initial sketch to work off of, and my team members drew up a more detailed diagram. After our discussions with other teams on Wednesday, I suggested that we narrow our focus and draw up a more simplified System Architecture Design. Ethan and I got the new diagram started, and I finalized it. Later in the week, we held a team meeting and worked on formulating our Project Proposal. My main contribution here was brainstorming the workload distribution.

This week we had a few members pull a late night on Tuesday, in preparation for Wednesday's class, which left us scrambling a bit before the group discussions on Wednesday. This week we plan to have a team meeting on Monday, or Tuesday, in order to be better prepared for the class discussions on Wednesday.

We got the System Architecture Diagram finished earlier in the week, which allowed us to focus on the Project Proposal this weekend. Next week I think we should replicate this by ensuring the Data Flow Diagram is completed in a similarly timely fashion, to avoid last minute scrambling over the weekend.

### Team Activities
- Discussed and drew up Data Flow Diagram
- Participated in class discussion about the Data Flow Diagram, and received feedback from professor
- Finalized Data Flow Diagram

### What went well
- Data Flow Diagram helped team gain clarity on project, in greater detail
- Discussions with other teams revealed similar Data Flow Diagram solutions, increasing the team's confidence in our own solutions
- Despite not being able to attend team meeting, I was able to contribute to the Data Flow Diagram later in the week. This was thanks to our decision to have a team meeting earlier in the week, allowing for more flexibility

### What didn't go well
- I personally was not able to attend the team meeting on Tuesday, as personal schedule conflicted

### Next Week's Plans
- Begin assigning tasks to members and start coding
- Ensure GitHub branches are organized and a system is in place to ensure smooth project workflow in the future

Last week was mostly spent on team meetings and assigning people to tasks. To do this, I drew up a revised Work Breakdown Structure after reviewing the finalized Milestone 1 requirements. Afterwards we held a team meeting to further hammer out the Work Breakdown Structure to come up with a distributed workload that the team was confident in. After this was achieved we moved onto initializing the project, and starting code contributions and reviews. Next sprint we plan to increase our frequency and volume of code contributions in order to establish a sustainable pace to complete all requirements for Milestone 1 within the deadline.

This past week included Quiz #1 and, for many members of the team, midterms in other classes. As a result we chose not to overload everyone, and instead focused on furthering code contributions in our given areas of responsibility. This adjustment works contrary to our plan of increasing our frequency and volume of code contributions, slightly, but it was a good adjustment for everyone's overall workload. I've started the code for Requirement 13: "Output all key information for a project." Next sprint appears to be lighter on my personal overall workload, and as such I plan to contribute more code and code reviews, sooner in the week. We have also identified a small issue with regards to GitHub branches where we have been merging our features into main, rather than the develop branch. We plan to amend this in the upcoming week.

### Previous Week:

I failed to complete one of the tasks I set out to do from last week's log. Although our intention was to reorganize GitHub branches by merging the main branch into the develop branch, code contributions came out sooner than that could be completed. We decided that it would be smoother to complete this week's code contributions, and merge the aforementioned branches first thing next week. I did start, and complete the code for Requirement 15: "Retrieve previously generated portfolio information." It has been implemented in such a way that it can be safely change in the future to accomodate our project as we see fit. Next week I plan on getting main merged into develop first thing and, once that is complete, I will start the code for Requirement 16: "Retrieve previously generated resume item."

This week I started work on syncing our main branch with develop, but ran into some issues that I couldn't figure out so that has been left as a work in progress. I've written the code to cover Requirement 16 :"Retrieve previously generated resume item." I realized that the code was very similar to Requirement 15, and so I refactored that into an item retriever module with wrappers for retrieving portfolio items, and resume items. This approach is much cleaner, and allows for scalability. The group has also agreed to use SQL Alchemy, rather than sqlite, and so I refactored my old code to accomodate this change. As a result, my work on Requirement 16 will need to be refactored before I can submit a PR for it.

This week I've finalized refactoring all code, including code for Requirement 16, to work with SQL Alchemy. Next week is reading week, so work will be light. Since all, or most, of the requirements have been covered, I intend to reasses where we're at, and discuss as a group, how to proceed. We may have the code for each requirement, but we need to ensure that all of the code is integrated properly into the overall program.

Coming back from reading week, we started the week off by reorienting the group and discussing the priorities for the final weeks of Milestone #1. For myself, I worked on completing code for Requirement 18: "Summarize the top-ranked projects." This went well, and next week I plan on contributing to whatever final integrations we need, including the possibility of deeper analysis of code contributions in different programming languages.

This week we spent integrating code, and preparing for next week's presentation. To this end, came together to plan and create a Text UI. My part of building the Text UI was writing the code that ensures that previously saved projects and analyses are able to be accessed from the database with a button click. Next week we will conduct our presentations, discuss next steps for the project following the presentations, and write and sign the Team Contract which is due at the end of the semester.

This week was spent wrapping up Milestone #1. We prepared and conducted our Presentation, watched other teams and completed Peer Evaluations, wrote and signed the Team Contract, and created the Video Demo. Individually, my main focus was writing up the Team Contract. Next week is the start of Christmas holidays, and so nothing is explicitly planned.
