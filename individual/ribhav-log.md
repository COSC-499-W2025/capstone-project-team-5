### Team Activities
- Reevaluated project requirements, iterated on system architecture and researched possible tech stack choices. 
- Participated in class discussion about the system architecture diagram. Made notes and took suggestions into consideration.

### What went well
- Lots of great ideas within the team in terms of prospective features. I was able to contribute to major decisions regarding the overall architecture of our system.
- We worked on the project proposal synchronously, while being on a call, so decisions were made easily and on the spot.
- Contributed to the requirements, and team member assignment for the project proposal.

### What didn't go well
- Some minor bumps around choosing between a strictly local architecture or having it split between cloud and local.
- Some difficulty finding time that fits everyone between the Monday and Wednesday class to iterate on the architecture. This should not be an issue for future weeks, since we decided on a time that works for everyone.

### Next Week's Plans
- Iterating on the DFD and having it ready well before class time, making sure all team members sign off on our submission.
- Personally researching ways to mine data effectively and data analysis, and sharing findings with the team over our Discord server.

### Team Activities
- Discussed DFD level 0 and level 1.
- Participated in class discussion about the the data flow diagram. Made notes and took suggestions into consideration.

### What went well
- We were done with our draft of the data flow diagram well before class time, with all team members signing off on it.
- Making notes of the observations we made during the in class discussion, that we could use for the individual quiz.

### What didn't go well
- Rather than working collaboratively, our workflow consisted of one person making an entire first draft by themself, and then everyone else chipping in and iterating on it.
- Some trouble catching up on DFD concepts from COSC 310

### Next Week's Plans
- Dividing up work fom the confirmed requirements and adjusting our system architeture diagram if any changes need to be made.
- Personally researching ways to mine data effectively and data analysis, and sharing findings with the team over our Discord server.
